Title: [A full data augmentation pipeline for small object detection based on generative adversarial networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320322004782#sec0011) PR <br>
Author: Brais Bosquet, Daniel Cores, Lorenzo Seidenari, VÃ­ctor M. Brea, Manuel Mucientes, Alberto Del Bimbo <br>
Model: GAN <br>
Dataset: [UAVDT](https://datasetninja.com/uavdt) Selected from 10 hours raw videos, about 80, 000 representative frames are fully annotated with bounding boxes as well as up to 14 kinds of attributes (e.g., weather condition, flying altitude, camera view, vehicle category, and occlusion) for three fundamental computer vision tasks: object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking. <br>
